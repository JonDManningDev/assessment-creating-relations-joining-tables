# Assessment: Creating Relations, Joining Tables

*This repo is my solution to the Qualified assessment for 6.6.4.*

*Write PostgreSQL scripts for join tables, given 3 example databases in /setup. Use AI to generate the first and write the rest independently (It was actually easier to write them independently than it was to use GitHub Copilot to generate the first. The AI instructions required such careful word choice that I could have simply written the code myself with less effort.).*
